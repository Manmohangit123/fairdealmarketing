## 🚀 Project Vision

Many aspiring entrepreneurs want to start businesses but lack capital.  
FairDeal enables middlemen to:

- Receive products without paying manufacturers upfront  
- Sell products directly to customers  
- Automatically split revenue via smart contracts:  
  - **Manufacturer:** 70-80% of sale price  
  - **Middleman:** 20-25% of sale price  

A win-win ecosystem backed by blockchain automation.

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:3000`
